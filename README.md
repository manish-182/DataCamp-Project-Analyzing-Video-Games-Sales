### DataCamp_Project-Analyzing-Video-Games-Sales
In this project, we'll explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. We'll compare a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.

Our database contains two tables:


#### game_sales
```markdown
|   column   |  type   |             meaning              |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| game       | varchar | Name of the video game           |
| platform   | varchar | Gaming platform                  |
| publisher  | varchar | Game publisher                   |
| developer  | varchar | Game developer                   |
| games_sold | float   | Number of copies sold (millions) |
| year       | int     | Release year                     |
 ```
 
#### reviews
```markdown
|    column    |  type   |               meaning                |
|--------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| game         | varchar | Name of the video game               |
| critic_score | float   | Critic score according to Metacritic |
| user_score   | float   | User score according to Metacritic   |
 ``` 
 
 --------------------------
 
 #### 1. Let's begin by looking at some of the top selling video games of all time!
 
 ```sql
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM game_sales
ORDER BY game_sold DESC
```

#### Output:

```markdown

|                   game                    | platform |    publisher     |     developer     | games_sold | year |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|-------------------|------------|------|
| Wii Sports for Wii                        | Wii      | Nintendo         | Nintendo EAD      |      82.90 | 2006 |
| Super Mario Bros. for NES                 | NES      | Nintendo         | Nintendo EAD      |      40.24 | 1985 |

| New Super Mario Bros. Wii for Wii         | Wii      | Nintendo         | Nintendo EAD      |      30.30 | 2009 |

```
----------------------
#### 2.  Missing review scores

The best-selling video games were released between 1985 to 2017! Let's look at the `reviews` table to gain more insight on the best years for video games.

First, it's important to check whether `reviews` table contains review score for all the movies? There may not be `reviews` data for some of the games on the `game_sales` table.

So, let's count the movies not having any review score

```sql
SELECT 
 COUNT (*) AS no_of_games_with_no_reviews
 ,(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM game_sales) AS tot_games
FROM game_sales AS s
LEFT JOIN reviews AS r
ON s.game = r.game
WHERE critic_score IS NULL
 AND user_score IS NULL
```

#### Output:

```markdown
| no_of_games_with_no_reviews | tot_games |
|-----------------------------|-----------|
|                          31 |       400 |
```


----------------------
#### 3. Which years did the video game critics loved the most?

It looks like a little less than ten percent of the games on the `game_sales` table don't have any reviews data. That's a small enough percentage that we can continue our exploration.

There are lots of ways to measure the best years for video games! Let's start with what the critics think.

```sql
SELECT TOP 10
 year
 ,ROUND (AVG (critic_score), 2) AS avg_critic_score
FROM game_sales AS s
INNER JOIN reviews AS r
ON s.game = r.game
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY avg_critic_score DESC
```
#### Output:

```markdown

| year | avg_critic_score |
|------|------------------|
| 1990 |             9.80 |
| 1992 |             9.67 |
| 1998 |             9.32 |
| 2020 |             9.20 |
| 1993 |             9.10 |
| 1995 |             9.07 |
| 2004 |             9.03 |
| 1982 |             9.00 |
| 2002 |             8.99 |
| 1999 |             8.93 |

```
----------------------
#### 4. Was 1982 really that great?

The range of great years according to critic reviews goes from 1982 until 2020: we are no closer to finding the golden age of video games!

Hang on, though. Some of those `avg_critic_score` values look like suspiciously round numbers for averages. The value for 1982 looks especially fishy. Maybe there weren't a lot of video games in our dataset that were released in certain years.

Let's look at the critic score for years that have more than four reviewed games.

```sql	
SELECT TOP 10
 year
 ,COUNT (*) AS num_games
 ,ROUND (AVG (critic_score), 2) AS avg_critic_score
FROM game_sales AS s
INNER JOIN reviews AS r
ON s.game = r.game
GROUP BY year
HAVING COUNT (*) > 4
ORDER BY avg_critic_score DESC
```

#### Output:

```markdown
| year | num_games | avg_critic_score |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| 1998 |        10 |             9.32 |
| 2004 |        11 |             9.03 |
| 2002 |         9 |             8.99 |
| 1999 |        11 |             8.93 |
| 2001 |        13 |             8.82 |
| 2011 |        26 |             8.76 |
| 2016 |        13 |             8.67 |
| 2013 |        18 |             8.66 |
| 2008 |        20 |             8.63 |
| 2017 |        13 |             8.62 |
```
----------------------
#### 5. Years that dropped off the critics' favorites list

That looks better! The `num_games` column convinces us that our new list of the critics' top games reflects years that had quite a few well-reviewed games rather than just one or two hits. 

But which years dropped off the list due to having four or fewer reviewed games? 

Let's identify them so that someday we can track down more game reviews for those years and determine whether they might rightfully be considered as excellent years for video game releases!

```sql
WITH top_critic_years AS  --Created CTE 
(
 SELECT TOP 10
  year
  ,ROUND (AVG (critic_score), 2) AS avg_critic_score
 FROM game_sales AS s
 INNER JOIN reviews AS r
 ON s.game = r.game
 GROUP BY year
 ORDER BY avg_critic_score DESC
),

top_critic_years_more_than_four_games AS --Created second CTE
(
 SELECT TOP 10
  year
  ,COUNT (*) AS num_games
  ,ROUND (AVG (critic_score), 2) AS avg_critic_score
 FROM game_sales AS s
 INNER JOIN reviews AS r
 ON s.game = r.game
 GROUP BY year
 HAVING COUNT (*) > 4
 ORDER BY avg_critic_score DESC
)

SELECT 
 year
 ,avg_critic_score
FROM top_critic_years

EXCEPT -- using except to list out years which are not included in #top_critic_years_more_than_four_games

SELECT 
 year
 ,avg_critic_score
FROM top_critic_years_more_than_four_games
ORDER BY avg_critic_score DESC
```

#### Output:

```markdown
| year | avg_critic_score |
|------|------------------|
| 1990 |             9.80 |
| 1992 |             9.67 |
| 2020 |             9.20 |
| 1993 |             9.10 |
| 1995 |             9.07 |
| 1982 |             9.00 |
```
----------------------
#### 6. Which years did the video game players loved the most?
It looks like the early 1990s might merit consideration as the golden age of video games based on `critic_score` alone.
Now, let's look at the `user_score` averages.

```sql
SELECT TOP 10
 year
 ,COUNT (*) AS num_games
 ,ROUND (AVG (user_score), 2) AS avg_user_score
FROM game_sales AS s
INNER JOIN reviews AS r
ON s.game = r.game
GROUP BY year
HAVING COUNT (*) > 4
ORDER BY avg_user_score DESC
```

#### Output:

```markdown
| year | num_games | avg_user_score |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1997 |         8 |            9.5 |
| 1998 |        10 |            9.4 |
| 2010 |        23 |           9.24 |
| 2009 |        20 |           9.18 |
| 2008 |        20 |           9.03 |
| 1996 |         5 |              9 |
| 2006 |        16 |           8.95 |
| 2005 |        13 |           8.95 |
| 2000 |         8 |            8.8 |
| 1999 |        11 |            8.8 |
```
----------------------
#### 7. Years that both players and critics loved
We've got a list of the top ten years according to both `critic reviews` and `user reviews`.

Are there any years that showed up on both tables? If so, those years would certainly be excellent ones!

Let's see which years fits in the category of golden years of video games as per both `critics` and `users`.

```sql
WITH top_critic_years_more_than_four_games AS --Created first CTE for critic scores
 (
 SELECT TOP 10
  year
  ,COUNT (*) AS num_games
  ,ROUND (AVG (critic_score), 2) AS avg_critic_score
 FROM game_sales AS s
 INNER JOIN reviews AS r
 ON s.game = r.game
 GROUP BY year
 HAVING COUNT (*) > 4
 ORDER BY avg_critic_score DESC
 ),
top_user_years_more_than_four_games AS ----Created first CTE for user scores
(
 SELECT TOP 10
  year
  ,COUNT (*) AS num_games
  ,ROUND (AVG (user_score), 2) AS avg_user_score
 FROM game_sales AS s
 INNER JOIN reviews AS r
 ON s.game = r.game
 GROUP BY year
 HAVING COUNT (*) > 4
 ORDER BY avg_user_score DESC
 )

SELECT year
FROM top_critic_years_more_than_four_games

INTERSECT -- using intersect to get values that exists in both the tables

SELECT year
FROM top_user_years_more_than_four_games
```

#### Output:

```markdown
| year |
|------|
| 1998 |
| 1999 |
| 2008 |
```
----------------------
#### 8. Sales in the best video game years

From the above, we get the idea that there are 3 years that both critics and users loves the most.

Now, let's see how those years has performed as per developers? 

``The tables created from above CTE are used here. So only the main query is displayed.``

```sql
SELECT
 year
 ,ROUND (SUM (game_sold),2) AS total_games_sold
FROM game_sales
WHERE year IN 
   (SELECT year
   FROM top_critic_years_more_than_four_games

   INTERSECT

   SELECT year
   FROM top_user_years_more_than_four_games
   )
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY total_games_sold DESC
```

#### Output:

```markdown
| year | total_games_sold |
|------|------------------|
| 2008 |           175.07 |
| 1998 |           101.52 |
| 1999 |             74.9 |
```
